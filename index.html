		<p>The movement to colonize Mars was founded by humans who dream of seeing footprints in the crimson dust of the Red Planet.</p>

		<p>Technological advances have made interplanetary travel possible, if not yet feasible. In October, NASA released a <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-releases-plan-outlining-next-steps-in-the-journey-to-mars/">plan</a> detailing the steps it&rsquo;s taking to land astronauts on Mars as early as the 2030s.</p>

		<p>But these steps taken for mankind have not been taken alone. Planetary scientists across the globe, including those at UCLA, help fuel NASA&rsquo;s goals daily, sketching new layers of detail upon our existing knowledge of space. In the past year alone, faculty-led initiatives have circled a <a href="http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/">dwarf planet</a> near Jupiter, designed a <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/dept/faculty/ucla-team-led-by-guvenc-oezel-win-nasa-prize-for-mars-habitat-design">3-D printed home</a> for future Martians and discovered a <a href="http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/16051/20150814/new-planet-formation-young-gassy-giant-methane-water.htm">new planet</a> 100 light-years away.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The real top-level question in astronomy and planetary science is about the origin and distribution of life,&rdquo; said David Jewitt, an earth, planetary and space sciences professor at UCLA. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ultimately what we would like to know &ndash; what I would like to know for sure.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>UCLA planetary science organizations such as <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~outreach/UCLA_outreach.html">Astronomy Live!</a> and the <a href="http://planets.ucla.edu/">Institute for Planets and Exoplanets</a>, or iPLEX, aim to inspire the next generation of scientists through outreach on and off campus. Scientists and engineers at UCLA continue to pursue the research questions most intriguing to planetary science: How does our Earth work? How can we find alien life? What exists beyond our stratosphere?</p>

		<p>A curiosity about space begins with the students.</p>

		<p>Stargazing in school</p>

		<p>Icy comets, asteroids and other celestial bodies rain <a href="http://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov/science/comet-primer/what-comet">about 40,000 tons</a> of primitive cosmic dust on Earth every year, occasionally igniting at our atmosphere&rsquo;s edge to paint bright meteoric strokes across the canvas of our sky.</p>

		<p>Real shooting stars are difficult to capture, study or explain to kids. That&rsquo;s when science educators turn to the kitchen.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Comets are called dirty snowballs for a reason,&rdquo; explains Dave Milewski, gritting his teeth as he wrestles with a bag of Windex, sand and corn syrup threatening to explode within a furious cloud of vaporizing dry ice. Milewski, a graduate student in astronomy, is recording a comet-making demonstration for the iPLEX website. He manages to pack the creamy brown mush into a sphere and cradles it beneath his lamp; the comet&rsquo;s liquid particles boil and hop from the surface like popcorn.</p>

		<img src="assets/Photos/AYU_1984.jpg"/>

		<p>The iPLEX faculty has demonstrated this process to kids and families at the annual <a href="http://planets.ucla.edu/outreach/exploring-your-universe/">Exploring Your Universe</a> outreach event. Representatives from iPLEX, UCLA science departments and local organizations give families rocket demos, science lectures and planetarium shows on UCLA&rsquo;s campus every November. More than 6,000 people attended the event in 2014.</p>

		<p>iPLEX is a networking and educational institution for more than 100 faculty members, researchers and graduate students who study planetary science across departmental lines, said Jewitt, founder and director of iPLEX.</p>

		<img src="assets/Photos/AYU_1998.jpg"/>

		<p>Since its launch in 2011, iPLEX has teamed up with graduate student group Astronomy Live! to bring space education to local schools six to eight times a month, showing curious students how to observe the sun using solar telescopes or construct models of the galaxy to scale.</p>

		<p>Schools from Central Valley to Manhattan Beach have requested a taste of space from UCLA, said iPLEX director's assistant Ivy Curren. iPLEX is also working to secure grants that would bring multiple schools to UCLA&rsquo;s campus for large events during the school year.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Every 5-year-old is kind of a scientist,&rdquo; Jewitt said. &ldquo;You play with everything, and that&rsquo;s how you figure out how to be a person. The real question is how to keep people with that childlike interest in science.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Just ask Milewski.</p>

		<p>Milewski &ndash; who, as a child, spent hours poring over astronomy books in the library &ndash;once read a theory about how the sun, in 4 billion years, would grow into a red giant and consume the Earth.</p>

		<p>A 6-year-old Milewski became very, very concerned with the future of humanity.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Ever since then, I&rsquo;m always thinking about space,&rdquo; Milewski said. &ldquo;Most people want to know what the origin of life is &ndash; what&rsquo;s our place in the universe. Even if I could just take people a few steps of the way, that would be my life&rsquo;s work, and I would be very happy with that.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>A painted comet streaks across the yellow wall behind his desk in the &ldquo;comet room,&rdquo; where he toils daily to study digital images of celestial objects called active asteroids. Observations have revealed that these rocky bodies can &ldquo;spit&rdquo; ice in intermittent spurts, sometimes with the force of a nuclear explosion at 5 kilometers per second.</p>

		<img src="assets/Photos/AYU_9418.jpg"/>

		<p>Milewski talked animatedly about the science of asteroids, satellites, brown dwarfs and space exploration. Still, he said he doesn&rsquo;t want to force science on anyone; he only hopes to get people just as excited about science as he is.</p>

		<img src="assets/Photos/AYU_9413.jpg"/>

		<p>Many UCLA students already are.</p>

		<p>Mission Control</p>

		<img src="assets/Photos/AYU_9487.jpg"/>

		<p>On a regular Tuesday in the Mathematical Sciences Building, engineers pop a little satellite out of an oven at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

		<p>Without its green circuit boards, the Electron Losses and Fields Investigation, or <a href="http://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/">ELFIN</a>, satellite resembles the bare framework of a house. A researcher throws on his lab coat and begins to clothe the miniature satellite, known as CubeSat, in circuit boards with special fasteners, showing a fellow researcher how to select the right screwdriver for the job.</p>

		<p>In late 2016 or early 2017, NASA will shoot the satellite into orbit so it can analyze space weather phenomena. NASA and the National Science Foundation have awarded ELFIN more than $1 million in funding since NASA selected it for the CubeSat Launch Initiative <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2014/08/18/forecast-from-space-satellite-built-by-student-team-may-help-predict-magnetic-storms/">in 2014</a>.</p>

		<p>The ELFIN CubeSat will circle the Earth, analyzing <a href="http://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/science/">interactions</a> between Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field and charged particles emitted from the sun. These interactions have numerous consequences on space weather, such as creating &ldquo;killer electrons&rdquo; harmful to spacecraft or giving us the aurora borealis &ndash; the northern lights we see tracing iridescent lines over our planet&rsquo;s poles.</p>

		<p>ELFIN researchers mean serious business. Some of them also happen to be undergraduate students at UCLA.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The best part about this project is bringing a concept to life, and that&rsquo;s the magic of it,&rdquo; said Lydia Bingley, ELFIN project manager and a graduate student in geophysics and space physics. &ldquo;This model existed on software simulations, and then we fabricated it in-house. ... Students essentially run the show.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>On Oct. 7, the students transported their satellite prototype to Virginia for vibration testing, where machines vigorously shook the satellite to simulate launch into orbit. ELFIN CubeSat passed the test.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;This is the future of education,&rdquo; said Vassilis Angelopoulos, an earth, planetary and space sciences professor who founded ELFIN in 2010. &ldquo;Whether ELFIN researchers go into academia or research, they (will apply) the same skills, solving challenging questions they believe in. That&rsquo;s the recipe, and they learn it now.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>A class at UCLA also gives students the opportunity to conduct hands-on research concerning the sky. Pauline Arriaga, an astronomy graduate student, teaches Astronomy 180: &ldquo;Astrophysics Laboratory,&rdquo; where students can conduct research on UCLA&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/planetarium/about/">largest telescope</a>.</p>

		<p>Arriaga recently upgraded the camera of the 41-year-old Cassegrain, which will sit within a white dome on the roof of the Mathematical Sciences Building until her class in spring quarter. She flips a switch on the hulking, cannon-like telescope, prompting a deep mechanical hum. A slice of the dome peels back to reveal a cloudy night.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What we can do is study systems and formation &ndash; stars that are being formed,&rdquo; said Arriaga, clicking through infrared photos taken of the Orion Nebula. The purple, flame-like dust clouds surrounding the nebula &ndash; a birthplace for stars &ndash; are only visible to the human eye through an infrared filter.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;This is my telescope,&rdquo; Arriaga joked, tinkering with the computers and controls within the dome. &ldquo;This one will keep going for a very long time.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Spacewalk</p>

		<p>As a UCLA professor, David Paige may not breathe Martian air during his lifetime, but the scientific contraption he&rsquo;s helping to build might get a whiff.</p>

		<p>In 2014, NASA selected a radar designed by the earth, planetary and space sciences professor and his colleagues to outfit the <a href="http://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/timeline/">Mars 2020</a> rover, which will depart for Mars in five years. The Radar Imager for Mars&rsquo; Subsurface Experiment, or <a href="http://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/science/for-scientists/instruments/rimfax/">RIMFAX</a>, is a ground-penetrating radar that will create a 2-D map of the Red Planet&rsquo;s subterranean layers.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;My colleague from Norway called me up and asked me if I wanted to get involved,&rdquo; said Paige, chuckling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit like a couple guys deciding to take a weekend trip to Las Vegas.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>In 2013, Paige chaired the international Present-Day Habitability of Mars <a href="http://mepag.nasa.gov/meeting/2013-02/present_day_habitability_mepag_report.pdf">conference</a> at UCLA. During the <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/seminars/featured-seminar-channels/workshops-without-walls/2013/2/4/present-day-habitability-of-mars-workshop/">broadcast</a> event, experts from all over the world, including from Russia and Germany, discussed the prospects and evidence of biological activity on Mars.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Understanding our place in the solar system and universe is important culturally, just to give people perspective,&rdquo; Paige said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s also the function of a university to reach out to the community and share what we&rsquo;re learning, discovering or teaching.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>NASA&rsquo;s recent announcements of <a href="http://www.space.com/17048-water-on-mars.html">salt water on Mars</a> and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/nh/nh-finds-blue-skies-and-water-ice-on-pluto">water-ice regions on Pluto</a> have garnered widespread attention. NASA&rsquo;s Instagram photo of Pluto gained the agency 300,000 new followers, according to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/nasas-social-media-strategy-genius-kinda-maddening/">WIRED magazine</a>. The popularity of NASA&rsquo;s social media accounts &ndash; numbering more than 500 in total &ndash; inspired iPLEX to launch its own Instagram this fall, Milewski said.</p>

		<p>But social media followers may be scrolling through pictures of alien microbes and extraterrestrial traces of life in the future. Last September, the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/news/nasa-program-2014.html">NASA/Library of Congress Astrobiology Symposium</a> invited science fiction expert and UCLA English professor Ursula Heise to Washington, D.C., to explore &ndash; along with other scholars &ndash; the cultural effects of alien life discovery, announcing to attendees that the topic had reached a new urgency. At one point, they discussed extraterrestrial life denialism, a social phenomenon much like the denial of climate change.</p>

		<p>Humans have continuously revised the themes of literary science fiction to reflect society&rsquo;s relationship with the environment, machines and the idea of leaving Earth for a second chance at society, Heise said.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Things change so fast around us that science fiction, in some sense, is the only genre that can really measure up (to progress),&rdquo; Heise said. &ldquo;We are, unintentionally, terraforming the Earth itself. ... That&rsquo;s one reason that suddenly now science fiction is resonating with our own present and what we think of as our future.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>***</p>

		<p>ELFIN, iPLEX and the physical sciences departments at UCLA will continue to pursue the goals of life discovery, deep-space exploration and interplanetary travel in the coming years. With iPLEX&rsquo;s new collaborative research <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/dept/faculty/may-27-ucla-and-jpl-to-sign-planetary-sciences-agreement-host-daylong-workshop">agreement</a> with NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, UCLA plans on making even more contributions to the race for space.</p>

		<p>In December, Jewitt will pay a visit to Hawaii&rsquo;s W.M. Keck Observatory, home to the world&rsquo;s largest optical and infrared telescopes. He hopes his two-night stay on the dormant volcano will bring him useful data for projects that he is working on &ndash; or hopes to work on soon.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;When I was a kid, teachers always gave me the impression that knowledge is this huge thing people have been accumulating forever, and it&rsquo;s so big you&rsquo;ll never get to the end of it,&rdquo; Jewitt said. &ldquo;But the edge of knowledge is so close. Sometimes it&rsquo;s only one question away.&rdquo;</p>
